# Gdzie jest kosz

## Backend project

This app uses Nest.js based backend as a Trash Bin database. It is located [here](https://github.com/patryk-bernasiewicz/gdzie-jest-kosz-backend).

## Project description

A mobile app that allows users to track their location in real-time using Leaflet map and see the trash bins added by them, or their community, in their area. It aims to solve the problem that lots of dog owners have during their walks, when the need comes to dispose of the dog poop, and trash bins are nowhere in the vicinity.

## Technology stack

- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript
- Leaflet (maps)
- Clerk (authentication)
- Jotai (state management)
- React Query (@tanstack/react-query)
- Testing Library for React Native
